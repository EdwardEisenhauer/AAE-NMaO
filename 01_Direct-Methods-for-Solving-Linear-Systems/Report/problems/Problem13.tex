\subsection{Problem 13}

Let $\matr{A}\matr{x} = \matr{b}$ , where $\matr{A} = \matr{I}_N \bigotimes \matr{C}^T\matr{C}$, the symbol $\bigotimes$ denotes the Kronecker product,
$\matr{I}_N \in R^{N \times N}$ is an identity matrix, $\matr{C} \in R^{M \times M}$ is a random matrix with a uniform distribution,
$M = 100$, and $N=50$, and $\matr{x} \sim N(0, I_{MN})$.
Find the direct method that solves the above system of linear equations with the lowest computational cost.
Estimate the cost with a roughly calculated number of flops and with the elapsed time.
