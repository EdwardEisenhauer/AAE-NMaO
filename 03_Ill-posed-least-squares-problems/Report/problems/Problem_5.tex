\subsection{Problem 5}%
\label{sec:problem_5}
A missile is fired from enemy territory, and its position in flight is observed by radar
tracking devices at the following positions:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $x_i$ [km] & 0 & 250 & 500 & 750 & 1000 \\
    \hline
    $y_i$ [km] & 0 & 8 & 15 & 19 & 20 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Suppose our intelligence sources indicate that enemy missiles are programed to follow a
parabolic flight path. Predict how far down range the missile will land.
