\end{tasks}

\subsubsection*{Mathematics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The system of inconsistent linear equations comprises linearly independent equations,
whose number is greater than the number of unknown variables.
Such a system may be expressed in the form:
\begin{equation*}
  \matr{Ax}=\matr{b}, \quad \text{where} \quad
  \matr{A}\in\mathfrak{R}^{m\times{}n}, \quad
  \matr{b}\in\mathfrak{R}^m, \quad
  \matr{x}\in\mathfrak{R}^n, \quad \text{and} \quad m\geq{}n
\end{equation*}
and has no solution. We may attempt to find the best approximate solution to such a
system by solving the minimization problem:
\begin{equation*}
  \min_{\matr{x}}{\left\lVert\matr{b}-\matr{A}\matr{x}\right\rVert}_2
\end{equation*}
For such a system, an associated system of \textit{normal equations} is defined to be:
\begin{equation}
  \matr{A}^T\matr{Ax}=\matr{A}^T\matr{b}
\end{equation}
which is always consistent.
The solution has the form:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:normal_approximation}
  \matr{x}=\left(\matr{A}^T\matr{A}\right)^{-1}\matr{A}^T\matr{b}
\end{equation}
