\begin{tasks}(3)
  \task $\systeme{3x_1-x_2=4,x_1+2x_2=0,2x_1+x_2=1}$
  \task $\systeme{3x_1+x_2+x_3=6,
  2x_1+3x_2-x_3=1,
  2x_1-x_2+x_3=0,
  3x_1-3x_2+3x_3=8}$
  \task $\systeme{x_1+x_2-x_3=5,
  2x_1-x_2+6x_3=1,
  -x_1+4x_2+x_3=0,
  3x_1+2x_2-x_3=6}$
\end{tasks}

The systems of inconsistent linear equations comprise linear independent equations,
which number is greater than the unknown variables.
Once again, such systems may be expressed in the form:
\begin{align*}
  \matr{Ax}=\matr{b}, & \text{where} &
  \matr{A}\in\mathfrak{R}^{m\times{}n}, &
  \matr{b}\in\mathfrak{R}^m, &
  \matr{x}\in\mathfrak{R}^n, & \text{and} & m\geq{}n
\end{align*}
For such a system, an associated system of \textit{normal equations} is defined to be:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:normal_approximation}
  \matr{A}^T\matr{Ax}=\matr{A}^T\matr{b}
\end{equation}
which is always consistent.
The solution has the form:
\begin{equation}
  \matr{x}=\left(\matr{A}^T\matr{A}\right)^{-1}\matr{A}^T\matr{b}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The solutions to all the systems of linear equations above may be easily approximated
with the \MATLAB{} function implementing~\eqref{eq:normal_approximation}:
