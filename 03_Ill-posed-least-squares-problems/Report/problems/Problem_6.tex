\subsection{Problem 6}%
\label{sec:problem_6}
Using least squares techniques, fit the following data
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $x_i$ & -5 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
    \hline
    $y_i$ & 2 & 7 & 9 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 14 & 13 & 10 & 8 & 4 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
with a line $y=a_0+a_1x$ and then fit the data with a quadratic $y=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2$.
Determine which of these two curves best fits the data by computing the $l_2$ norm of
the errors in each case.
