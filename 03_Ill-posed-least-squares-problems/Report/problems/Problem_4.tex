\label{sec:problem_4}
Using least squares find the ``best'' straight-line fit and the error estimates for the
slope and intercept of that line for the following set of data:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $x_i$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
    \hline
    $y_i$ & 1.5 & 2.0 & 2.8 & 4.1 & 4.9 & 6.3 & 5.0 & 11.5 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
