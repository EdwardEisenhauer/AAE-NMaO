\subsection{Problem 3}%
\label{sec:problem_3}
The yield $y$ of wheat in quintals per hectare appears to be a linear function of the
number of days $x_1$ of sunshine, the number of centimeters $x_2$ of rainfall, and the
number of kilograms $x_3$ of fertilizer per hectare. Find the best fit to the data in
the table with an equation in the form: $y=a_0+a_1x_1+a_2x_2+a_3x_3$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  $y$ & $x_1$ & $x_2$ & $x_3$ \\
  \hline
  28 & 50 & 18 & 10 \\
  \hline
  30 & 40 & 20 & 16 \\
  \hline
  21 & 35 & 14 & 10 \\
  \hline
  23 & 40 & 12 & 12 \\
  \hline
  23 & 30 & 16 & 14 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
