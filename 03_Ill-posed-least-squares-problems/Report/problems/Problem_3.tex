\subsection{Problem 3}%
\label{sec:problem_3}
The yield $y$ of wheat in quintals per hectare appears to be a linear function of the
number of days $x_1$ of sunshine, the number of centimeters $x_2$ of rainfall, and the
number of kilograms $x_3$ of fertilizer per hectare. Find the best fit to the data in
the table with an equation in the form: $y=a_0+a_1x_1+a_2x_2+a_3x_3$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  $y$ & $x_1$ & $x_2$ & $x_3$ \\
  \hline
  28 & 50 & 18 & 10 \\
  \hline
  30 & 40 & 20 & 16 \\
  \hline
  21 & 35 & 14 & 10 \\

Despite the function above depends on three variables, the reasoning follows the one
from the~\nameref{sec:problem_2}.

\subsubsection*{Solution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Following the previous problems we have:
\begin{equation*}
  \matr{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 50 & 18 & 10 \\
    1 & 40 & 20 & 16 \\
    1 & 35 & 14 & 10 \\
    1 & 40 & 12 & 12 \\
    1 & 30 & 16 & 14
  \end{bmatrix} \qquad
  \matr{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
    28 \\
    30 \\
    21 \\
    23 \\
    23
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
\lstinputlisting[style=Matlab-editor]{problems/Problem_3.m}
\begin{equation*}
  \matr{a} = \begin{bmatrix}
    -5.1890 \\
    \phantom{-}0.3384 \\
    \phantom{-}0.5128 \\
    \phantom{-}0.7085
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
from which we get:
\begin{equation*}
  y= - 5.1890 + 0.3384x_1 + 0.5128x_2 + 0.7085x_3
\end{equation*}
