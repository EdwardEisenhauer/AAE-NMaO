\subsection{Problem 2}%
\label{sec:problem_2}
Solve the following system of linear equations using the selected iterative solvers:
\begin{equation*}
  \systeme{x_1+x_2+x_3=1,x_1+x_2+2x_3=2,x_1+2x_2+2x_3=1}
\end{equation*}
Compare and discuss the computational costs with respect to convergence rates.
Start the iterations from $\matr{x}^{(0)}=\matr{0}$.
