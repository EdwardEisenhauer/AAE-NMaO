Solve the following system with the selected iterative solvers
\begin{equation*}
  \systeme{2u-v=0,-u+2v-w=0,-v+2w-z=0,-w+2z=5}
\end{equation*}
Estimate the computational costs and convergence rates.
Start the iterations from zero-value initial guess.

The principle of the iterative linear solvers of the linear system of equations
expressed as $\matr{A}\matr{x}=\matr{b}$ is to start with some initial guess
$\matr{x}^{(0)}$ and approximate the solution with each step.
\todo[inline]{Develop the iterative methods' mathematical description.}
\begin{equation*}
  \matr{S}\matr{}
  \matr{x}^{(k+1)} = \matr{G}\matr{x}^{(k)} + \matr{c}
\end{equation*}

As an iterative method may not converge, a good idea is to determine it for a given problem, calculating the error.
\todo[inline]{Describe the error calculation.}

Assuming we know the exact solution $\matr{x}^*$:
\begin{equation*}
  e^k = \matr{x}^k - \matr{x}^*
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
  e^k = \matr{G}^k * \matr{e}^0
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Solution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Since the considered system of linear equations is simple and consistent, we may use the
\MATLAB's backslash operator in the form of \lstinline[style=Matlab-editor]{A\b}, to
determine the exact solution:
\begin{equation*}
  \matr{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
    \phantom{-}2 & -1 & \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}0 \\
    -1 & \phantom{-}2 & -1 & \phantom{-}0 \\
    \phantom{-}0 & -1 & \phantom{-}2 & -1 \\
    \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}0 & -1 & \phantom{-}2
  \end{bmatrix}, \qquad
  \matr{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\
    0 \\
    0 \\
    5
  \end{bmatrix}, \qquad
  \matr{x}^* = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    2 \\
    3 \\
    4
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Before proceeding with calculating the approximate solution, we check the residual error
at the 100th iteration for each of the implemented algorithms to verify if the method
converges. The convergence criterion is:
\begin{equation*}
  \lim_{k\to\infty}{e} = 0
  \quad \text{if} \quad
  \max{\lvert\lambda_n\rvert}<1
  \quad \text{for} \quad
  \matr{G}^{k}
\end{equation*}
Let's verify it for each of our algorithms:
