Solve the following system with the selected iterative solvers
\begin{equation*}
  \systeme{2u-v=0,-u+2v-w=0,-v+2w-z=0,-w+2z=5}

Estimate the computational costs and convergence rates.

The principle of the iterative linear solvers of the $\matr{A}\matr{x}=\matr{b}$ is to
start with some initial guess $\matr{x}^0$ and approximate the solution with each step.

\begin{equation*}
  \matr{S}\matr{}
  \matr{x}^{(k+1)} = \matr{G}\matr{x}^{(k)} + \matr{c}
\end{equation*}

To determine if there is a sense of using a given method we should look into the error.

Assuming we know the exact solution $\matr{x}^*$:
\begin{equation*}
  e^k = \matr{x}^k - \matr{x}^*
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
  e^k = \matr{G}^k * \matr{e}^0
\end{equation*}


\begin{equation*}
  e^k = \matr{G}^k * \matr{e}^0
\end{equation*}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Solution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The considered system of the linear equations may be expressed as the matrices:
\begin{equation*}
  \matr{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
    \phantom{-}2 & -1 & \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}0 \\
    -1 & \phantom{-}2 & -1 & \phantom{-}0 \\
    \phantom{-}0 & -1 & \phantom{-}2 & -1 \\
    \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}0 & -1 & \phantom{-}2
  \end{bmatrix}, \qquad
  \matr{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\
    0 \\
    0 \\
    5
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Before proceeding with finding the solution it is reasonable to enusre that the used
method will converge. The convergence criterion is:
\begin{equation*}
  \lim_{k\to\infty}{e} = 0
  \quad \text{if} \quad
  \max{\lvert\lambda_n\rvert}<1
  \quad \text{for} \quad
  \matr{G}^{k}
\end{equation*}
