\subsection{Problem 2}%
\label{sec:problem_2}
Perform the forward projection of the exact solution
$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}^T$
onto the range space spanned by the columns in the matrix:
\begin{equation*}
    A = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\
        2 & 4 & 4 & 6 & 2 \\
        3 & 6 & 6 & 9 & 6 \\
        1 & 2 & 4 & 5 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Assuming the linear forward projection model, try to estimate the true solution to
$\matr{Ax} = \matr{b}$ given $\matr{A}$ and $\matr{b}$.
Then change the $a_{21}$ entry from 2 to 0 and repeat the estimation.
Explain the difference.
Compute the residual and solution errors.
Which algorithm gives the best estimate and why?
Which metrics are best to solbe this problem?
