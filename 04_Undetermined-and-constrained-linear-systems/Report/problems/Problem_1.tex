\subsection{Problem 1}%
\label{sec:problem_1}
Find a condition on the numbers $a, b, c$ such that the following system of equations is
consistent. When that condition is satisfied, find all solutions
(in terms of $a, b, \text{and}, c$):
\begin{equation*}
  \systeme{x+3y+z=a,
  -x-2y+z=b,
  3x+7y-z=c}
\end{equation*}
Then choose the numbers $a, b, c$ to satisfy the conditions:
\begin{tasks}
  \task $x=0, y=3, z=1$
  \task $x=0, y=0, z=1$
  \task $x=-2, y=1, z=0$
\end{tasks}
For the computed numbers $a, b, c$, estimate the solutions using the Regularized FOCUSS
algorithm.

Following the manual calculations of the Gaussian Elimination, we transform the matrix
to the Row Reduced Echelon Form:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    \begin{amatrix}{1}{1}
        \matr{A} & \matr{b}
    \end{amatrix} = 
    \begin{amatrix}{3}{1}
        \phantom{-}1 & \phantom{-}3 & \phantom{-}1 & a\\
        -1 & -2 & \phantom{-}1 & b\\
        \phantom{-}3 & \phantom{-}7 & -1 & c
    \end{amatrix} &\xrightarrow[R_3 + 3R_2]{R_2 + R_1}
    \begin{amatrix}{3}{1}
      \phantom{-}1 & \phantom{-}3 & \phantom{-}1 & a\\
      \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}1 & \phantom{-}2 & b + a\\
      \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}1 & \phantom{-}2 & c + 3b
  \end{amatrix} \xrightarrow[R_3 - R_2]{R_1 - 3R_2}\\
  \xrightarrow[R_3 - R_2]{R_1 - 3R_2}
  \begin{amatrix}{3}{1}
    \phantom{-}1 & \phantom{-}0 & -5 & -3b -2a\\
    \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}1 & \phantom{-}2 & b + a\\
    \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}0 & c + 2b - a
  \end{amatrix} &
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
From the RREF we may conclude that there are only two possibilities: either the system
has no solutions when $c + 2b - a \neq 0$, or it has infinitely many solutions when
$c + 2b - a = 0$ --- in that case, the system is consistent.
Additionally, the $z$ is a free variable.
Now we may proceed with substituting the variables:
\begin{equation*}
  \text{for}
  \begin{cases}
  x=0\\
  y=3\\
  z=1
  \end{cases}
  \text{we get}
  \begin{cases}
  a=0+3*3+1=10\\
  b=0-2*3+1=-5\\
  c=0+7*3-1=20
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
