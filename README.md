# Numerical Methods and Optimization

This repository contains the collection of laboratory reports for the Numerical Methods
and Optimization at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

## TODO

- [ ] Create a top-level `bibliography.bib` file which the source TeX files for each
      report use.
- [ ] Refine Lab 1 Problem 2. Develop the description of the LU factorization
      and consider changing the method not-involving P and Q matrices.
